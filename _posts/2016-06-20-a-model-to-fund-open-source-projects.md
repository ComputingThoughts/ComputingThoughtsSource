title: A Model To Fund Open-source Projects
---

Synopsis
--------

Place a bounty on the next release of an open-source project. Until the bounty is
met, those who need/want the newest release must pay an amount in order to get it
(the previous releases remain free during this period). Once the bounty is met,
the new release becomes free.

The Problem of Funding
----------------------

bounty usually based on the effort you and your group put in
amounts are probably different for individuals and companies, and companies might pay
according to how big they are or some other factors
you can even provide premiums like stickers, shirts or hats for individuals who are extra enthusiastic
I'm not sure about some of the details, for example:
- Could you call this a donation and set a minimum donation? If so you might be able to charge more to companies since they would benefit from the tax break.
- Could this donation model be accomplished under the umbrella of an organization like the *Python Software Foundation* (PSF)?

This system might even provide funding for an organization like the PSF. If the PSF were to create and host the infrastructure for this service, they could take a percentage for doing so (and I think folks in the Python open-source community would be enthusiastic in providing another way to fund the PSF, so the percentage could probably be higher than what Kickstarter, for example, charges).

Summary
-------
Not the only option, of course. ReadTheDocs example. It will be most appropriate for products and libraries that involve a steady addition of features with new releases.
Doesn't solve the problem of funding the startup of an open-source project, which is different and closer to traditional crowdfunding, where you are taking a distinct risk that the project might never reach fruition. For that we probably need to draw on the wisdom earned both from venture investing and services like Kickstarter and 
I think I might have been able to think of this approach because of my [Reinventing Business](Reinventing-Business.com) project.
