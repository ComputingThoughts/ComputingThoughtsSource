title: The Next Big Things
---

I gave the opening keynote at the JET conference in Minsk, Belarus. Despite
being sick the whole trip, I really enjoyed it all. The people were
especially friendly and appreciative---I heard from many conference
attendees that *Thinking in Java* was their very first programming book.

I spoke about the importance of the ecosystems and culture around
programming languages, and that evaluating a programming language involved
more than just looking at its technology. Because of this, one question
kept coming up during my time there: "What will be the next big thing in
programming?" I didn't have the answer then but I've been thinking about
it since.

The hard part about predicting the future is getting stuck in thinking that
it will be more of the same. This is legitimate: we tend to see incremental
developments in areas that are successful. But when you're looking for sea
changes, you have to step back and look for the big pain points---points
that often require so much effort on our parts that we end up so immersed
that we can't recognize that we need to fundamentally shift the world.

Here are three big ideas that I've come up with to answer the questions
from the Bela Russians, and why I think they might happen.

1. Integrated Dynamic Security

2. A model for parallelism

2. Java++
