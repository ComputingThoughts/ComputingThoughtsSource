title: Notes from The Elm Developer Retreat
---

1. We all agreed that developer retreats are great, and we will continue doing them and evolving the format.
    A. It's much, much easier to figure things out in a group.
2. We all agreed that Elm is really great and none of us ever want to write Javascript again (to be honest we already didn't want to write Javascript anymore).
3. On the first day we went through (videos), which are out of date from 0.17 (he's working on an updated version which I will happily get), and we found this an excellent way to get everyone up to speed. When we ran into problems we stopped the video and figured them out. We also stopped and fixed the example code to make it work with 0.17, and that was an excellent exercise as well.
3. Chromecast is a great way to work in groups to go through and explain code.
4. There are a lot of useful resources for learning Elm. I've captured a number of them, along with the link to our Github repository, at the bottom of this post.
5. We tried Google spaces. It's nice and easy but it has a number of drawbacks compared to Slack that were show-stoppers for us. So at the Winter Tech Forum we'll continue using Slack.
    A. Messages can only be 170 characters.
    B. You can't do code snippets like you can in Slack.

Resources
---------

- Our Github repository. Most of the subdirectories represent one person.
- Richard Felman's Elm book is a very good introduction, even though only the first three chapters are complete so far.
  Richard works side-by-side with Evan so the accuracy of this book seems like it should be very reliable.
- package.elm-lang.org: lots of examples that other people have created. You find lots of new features
  that you don't see in other literature.
