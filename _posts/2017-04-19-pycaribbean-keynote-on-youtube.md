title: PyCaribbean Keynote On Youtube
---
I gave the closing keynote at PyCaribbean, the Python conference held in Puerto Rico.
You can see it [On YouTube](https://youtu.be/_ncc69-cunA), and the slides are available
[here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14P28OEOgNgFF6wx6rHlnwYJ6X4SgApoTJ1mB9lndN1E/edit?usp=sharing).

I think a closing keynote should give more perspective and look at things from a higher
point of view. By then, the audience is full of technical information and, I believe, looking
for relief rather than more code.

Even though I was a physics major as an undergraduate, I've begun to realize over the last ten years
or so that I didn't understand what science was, and that's probably why I was at best only a mediocre
physics student. I thought that science was about "the truth," so I had a very hard time when
the teacher manipulated models, throwing away higher-order terms and arguing that a
billiard-balls-and-springs model that produced a specific heat within an order of magnitude was
"pretty darn good."

Had I understood that science is just coming up with a model that fits the data,
I wouldn't have been stuck on ideas of the truth. That is not to say that
science doesn't *disprove* models, because it certainly does---indeed, that's
all you can know with any certainty. A model works until it doesn't, and then
you must either make adjustments or throw it away altogether and come up with a
new one.

One way to think about science is that it is built on doubt, down to the point
that we don't even bother trying to believe whether our models are true or not.
They just fit the data...so far. Whereas what came before the scientific revolution
was belief without evidence, and doubt had to be crushed lest the whole operation
topple.

So what I do in this presentation is look at a lot of different sciences and see how
they work and when they don't, and finally ask the question of whether computer science
is actually a science (aspects of it certainly seem to be, while other parts are
clearly not).

I did learn something important from the video. I had just used one of Google's standard
slide formats, and the video is just a camera pointed at both me and the screen. This
is certainly the easiest way to capture a presentation, and I can't count the number of
videos I've watched where they had hired a "professional" who kept pointing the camera
at the speaker when the speaker was describing code, and at the screen when there was
nothing interesting going on there. But I will be thinking in the future of the one-static-camera
capture and ensure that the font and background are contrasty enough, and of course large
enough. In the past this wasn't even an option because pointing a camera at a video projection
would cause all kinds of interference; technology has improved to the point where this
is no longer an issue.
