This year I repeated my strategy of "Don't go to any recorded sessions," and
also did more volunteering (one of these was at the green room, and again one
of the session chairs failed to show up so you'll see me introducing three of
the talks).

### Virtual Environments Revisited

Setting up the virtual environment for this project was one of my learning
experiences. When you install a package that you want to modify and test, it
turns out that you must make it editable using the `-e` flag, as in `pip
install -e`. Otherwise your changes won't be seen and used, and only the
original installation will ever be seen. Without knowing this I experienced
some frustration until Russel walked me through it. If I hadn't been doing
this in a sprint, I probably would have given up.

In the process, I ended up making multiple installations and building the
virtual environment multiple times. I also realized that I sometimes hesitate
to build a virtual environment because I have to look up and re-learn the
configuration commands, and running the `activate` script is always annoying.
If only we could get the computer to do annoying, repetetive things for us!
Here's a Windows batch file that does the trick (anyone with basic shell
skills can create the equivalent for Mac/Linux):

```bat
@echo off
rem venv.bat

if exist virtualenv (
  if defined VIRTUAL_ENV (
    virtualenv\Scripts\deactivate.bat
  ) else (
    virtualenv\Scripts\activate.bat
  )
) else (
  py -m venv virtualenv
  virtualenv\Scripts\activate.bat
)
```

I'm choosing to call my virtual environment directory `virtualenv`, and so can
use that directory's existence to indicate whether there's an installed
virtual environment.

You can place `venv.bat` somewhere in your Windows `PATH` and use it anytime
you want to create and use virtual environments. Note that for it to work
correctly, you must call it from the subdirectory where the `virtualenv`
directory will be created or already exists.

`activate.bat` sets `VIRTUAL_ENV` and `deactivate.bat` clears it, so
`VIRTUAL_ENV` means that the virtual environment has been activated. This way,
running `venv` just turns it on if it's off, and off if it's on, so there's
two less commands I need to remember.

If the virtual environment doesn't exist, it is created and activated. But
while working on Toga, I needed the special installations in that new
environment, so I created a local `venv.bat` and added the following lines
after the virtual environment creation and activation:

```bat
  cd src\core
  pip install -e .
  cd ..\winforms
  pip install -e .
  cd ..\..
  pip install -e .
```


Notes
-----

The rest of the time I sought out experiences and interactions. And this is a place where
the smart phone really has enhanced my life: whenever anyone said something interesting, I
pulled out the phone and entered it in a list in Google Keep. I used to make notes and then
set them aside and forget them, but entering them in the smart phone when I know they will
show up on all my other devices seems to really make the key difference.

Here are my notes, in no particular order:

- *Work is Not a Dare* by [Shawn Rider](http://shawnrider.com/) from
  the [Open Source and Feelings](http://www.osfeels.com/) conference.
  [Slides](https://www.slideshare.net/shawnrider/work-is-not-a-dare-tips-for-building-inclusive-teams)
  [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdHH5KWGTNo).

- [PyInstaller](http://www.pyinstaller.org/) for creating easy end-user installers.

- [Pint](https://pint.readthedocs.io/en/0.8/) a units library for working with physical quantities.

- [Bypthon](https://www.bpython-interpreter.org/). Another Python REPL prettifier. Alas, says it works
  on Windows but doesn't. Remember, roughly 95% of the machines out their run Windows, so saying that
  whatever machine you are using "is better and everyone should just use it" doesn't really help promote
  Python. [PtPython](https://github.com/jonathanslenders/ptpython) does work on Windows, for example.
