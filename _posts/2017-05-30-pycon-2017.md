This year I repeated my strategy of "Don't go to any recorded sessions," and
also did more volunteering (one of these was at the green room, and again one
of the session chairs failed to show up so you'll see me introducing three of
the talks).


Dinners
-------

In the past I've kind of stumbled into dinner groups, but not always. This
time I made more of an effort and was rewarded with dinner friends every
night. I think, however, that I'd like to make more of an effort to pre-plan
these next year somehow, perhaps using some online tool. Admittedly this could
reduce the chances for serendipity, but once a core of people are going to
dinner it's not usually hard to add others.

I wonder if there's already an app for setting up group dinners. One of the
hopeful things that happened is that I discovered that someone I have started
to know is a web developer and we've agreed to do some experiments. I've been
approached by any number of people over time who want to build web projects,
but these are invariably people who have figured out how to configure a
technology (often Wordpress, which I've come to loathe) and recommend that I
use that particular technology. But in this case, I've got a real programmer
who can adapt to my arcane needs. As a result, I've started imagining asking
him to create all kinds of new experiments, and one of these could be a dinner
planner app for conferences. The possibilities for this and other ideas are
very exciting.

Hunting for Self-Guided Tutorials
---------------------------------

For years, many people in Crested Butte have expressed to me an interest in
learning to program, while declaring they know nothing about it. Perhaps the
idea gestated long enough, or some other experienced triggered this, but I
recently began formulating a new kind of class for new programmers that relies
completely on self-guided tutorials. The benefit of this is that people do not
get driven away by the class going either too fast or too slow; by its nature
it adapts to the learning experience of each individual. In addition, once
anyone has solved one of the steps, they can help their classmates solve that
step (indeed, they are probably better at it, being closer to "beginner's
mind").



Open Spaces
-----------

Although I attended more open spaces than the ones described here, these
were the ones I found most engaging.

### Inclusion

### Improve Your Writing

### Starting Teal Organizations

Sprint days
-----------

Last year was my first experience sprinting (If you don't consider what was
arguably the very first sprint, coached by Jim Fulton at Zope Corp in Virginia
after one of the D.C. Pycons -- but I can't remember much from that one; I do
know he tried to teach us Git but for me it didn't take then). Then I went to
many different projects and contributed a little to each one, primarily either
documentation or testing their onboarding process, but in a few cases I added
code. I learned a great deal through this sampling process, but this year
I ended up spending all three days (and wishing I had the fourth) on a single
project: [Beeware](https://pybee.org/).

I've been experimenting with and using a small decorator framework for building
command-line applications, much like (for example) [Click](http://click.pocoo.org)
although mine is much simpler. I have a friend or two who would like some
automation, so I've been imagining that a command-line system would work for them.

But then a friend pointed out that most people have no idea what the shell is, and
are unfamiliar with command-line applications. At Pycon it occurred to me that it
might be possible to use the same decorator approach, but instead of producing
a command-line option, the decorator would insert a menu item in a windowed program,
and thus be easier and more familiar for the vast majority of users, while at the
same time making the creation of such a program vastly easier. I went to the Beeware
booth and ask the creator, Russell Keith-Magee (whom I had met and spent time with
at [PyCarribbean](http://bruceeckel.github.io/2017/04/19/pycaribbean-keynote-on-youtube/)),
if he thought this was possible and he said yes.

It turns out his answer was a bit ... premature. When you go to the [Beeware Site](https://pybee.org/),
It's a bit hard to discover where to start. There's a reason for that: this is a collection
of projects, so you must first (A) Know that and (B) Decide what project fits your needs.
And even then, some parts of the project are still more visionary than completely fleshed out,
so you won't always find a tutorial or example of what you're looking for.

I quite *like* the vision of BeeWare: make Python work everywhere. I think it will get there.
We even had some discussions about funding to make it so Russ (and ideally other programmers)
could work on it full time, and get it there faster. But be warned that at this writing the
vision is only partly there.

The sub-project that met my needs is called [Toga](https://github.com/pybee/toga), with
[Docs here](https://toga.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

### Virtual Environments Revisited

Setting up the virtual environment for this project was one of my learning
experiences. When you install a package that you want to modify and test, it
turns out that you must make it editable using the `-e` flag, as in `pip
install -e`. Otherwise your changes won't be seen and used, and only the
original installation will ever be seen. Without knowing this I experienced
some frustration until Russel walked me through it. If I hadn't been doing
this in a sprint, I probably would have given up.

In the process, I ended up making multiple installations and building the
virtual environment multiple times. I also realized that I sometimes hesitate
to build a virtual environment because I have to look up and re-learn the
configuration commands, and running the `activate` script is always annoying.
If only we could get the computer to do annoying, repetetive things for us!
Here's a Windows batch file that does the trick (anyone with basic shell
skills can create the equivalent for Mac/Linux):

```bat
@echo off
rem venv.bat

if exist virtualenv (
  if defined VIRTUAL_ENV (
    virtualenv\Scripts\deactivate.bat
  ) else (
    virtualenv\Scripts\activate.bat
  )
) else (
  py -m venv virtualenv
  virtualenv\Scripts\activate.bat
)
```

I'm choosing to call my virtual environment directory `virtualenv`, and so can
use that directory's existence to indicate whether there's an installed
virtual environment.

You can place `venv.bat` somewhere in your Windows `PATH` and use it anytime
you want to create and use virtual environments. Note that for it to work
correctly, you must call it from the subdirectory where the `virtualenv`
directory will be created or already exists.

`activate.bat` sets `VIRTUAL_ENV` and `deactivate.bat` clears it, so
`VIRTUAL_ENV` means that the virtual environment has been activated. This way,
running `venv` just turns it on if it's off, and off if it's on, so there's
two less commands I need to remember.

If the virtual environment doesn't exist, it is created and activated. But
while working on Toga, I needed the special installations in that new
environment, so I created a local `venv.bat` and added the following lines
after the virtual environment creation and activation:

```bat
  cd src\core
  pip install -e .
  cd ..\winforms
  pip install -e .
  cd ..\..
  pip install -e .
```


Notes
-----

The rest of the time I sought out experiences and interactions. And this is a place where
the smart phone really has enhanced my life: whenever anyone said something interesting, I
pulled out the phone and entered it in a list in Google Keep. I used to make notes and then
set them aside and forget them, but entering them in the smart phone when I know they will
show up on all my other devices seems to really make the key difference.

Here are my notes, in no particular order:

- *Work is Not a Dare* by [Shawn Rider](http://shawnrider.com/) from
  the [Open Source and Feelings](http://www.osfeels.com/) conference.
  [Slides](https://www.slideshare.net/shawnrider/work-is-not-a-dare-tips-for-building-inclusive-teams)
  [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdHH5KWGTNo).

- [PyInstaller](http://www.pyinstaller.org/) for creating easy end-user installers.

- [Pint](https://pint.readthedocs.io/en/0.8/) a units library for working with physical quantities.

- [Bypthon](https://www.bpython-interpreter.org/). Another Python REPL prettifier. Alas, says it works
  on Windows but doesn't. Remember, roughly 95% of the machines out their run Windows, so saying that
  whatever machine you are using "is better and everyone should just use it" doesn't really help promote
  Python. [PtPython](https://github.com/jonathanslenders/ptpython) does work on Windows, for example.


The Concurrent Python Project
-----------------------------

I've started working on a big, ambitious Python project: a book called
[Concurrent Python](www.ConcurrentPython.com) which assumes you know Python
but that you don't know anything about concurrency. I considered writing (yet
another) introductory book, but realized that there are already plenty of good
ones and that I wouldn't contribute much there. Concurrency, however, is a
topic I've struggled with over the years and I know I could add some value to
that discussion. It also presents opportunities for much more interesting
training, conferences, speaking and consulting (these days I'm far more
invested in discovering stimulating experiences, instead of just any
experiences).

The first chapter has mostly been taken from the Concurrency chapter in [On
Java 8](www.OnJava8.com), which is now available in beta (as in "nearly
finished") form but still requires work. The Atomic Kotlin book has also
inserted itself in my schedule. So don't expect a lot of progress right now,
although I am thinking about it and watching for ideas, tools and libraries
which I'm capturing in the [00_Notes.md](https://github.com/BruceEckel/ConcurrentPython/blob/master/Chapters/00_Notes.md) file -- feel free to make pull requests or add issues if you
think something belongs there.
