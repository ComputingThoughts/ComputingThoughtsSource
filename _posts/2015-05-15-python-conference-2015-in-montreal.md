title: Python Conference 2015 In Montreal

Something I've really come to love about modern conferences is the quality of video presentations that are produced and distributed on the web. I think this is evolution in action: the new format is big slides, taken directly from the slide deck so they are extremely clear. Next to that is a smaller inset of the speaker, because people have figured out that you don't get that much from seeing the speaker. Sometimes it's helpful, but most of the information is in the presentation material and the audio. So those two things have gotten better and better, and the speaker window has gotten appropriately smaller.
