# Bruce Eckel's Programming Blog

Based on [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon), which is a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme that places content first by tucking away navigation in a hidden drawer. It's based on [Poole](http://getpoole.com), the Jekyll butler.

Just to experiment, I set this up without installing any tools locally on my laptop. I write the posts using MarkdownPad, and then push it to the git repository and github does everything else.
